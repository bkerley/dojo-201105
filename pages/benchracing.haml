        # Bench Racing
        Given a list of cars, each with weight and horsepower figures, find the
        power-to-weight ratio for each, and sort them from highest to lowest.

        ## List of Cars
        This list is formatted name of car, space, weight in pounds, space,
        horsepower. I made some of these numbers up, so don't go car shopping
        or gambling with them.

        cars.txt:
            mustang 3400 300
            zonda 4000 680
            mirage 2300 100
            murciÃ©lago 3640 631
            raptor 5860 411
            fortwo 1800 70

        ## Things to know

        Reading a file into an array lines:
            lines = File.read('file.txt').lines.to_a

        Splitting a string on spaces:
            words = "aeropress coffee" #=> ["aeropress", "coffee"]

        Sorting an array based on some math:
            sorted = lines.sort_by{|e| e[1].to_i + e[2].to_i }
        
        Printing an array with a space between each entry:
            puts words.join(" ")

        Printing an array with each entry on its own line:
            puts lines

        ## Template
        benchracing.rb
            # cars = each line from cars.txt
            # sorted_cars = sort cars by
              # car power / car weight
              
            # print the sorted_cars array
