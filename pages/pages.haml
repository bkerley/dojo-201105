        # Pages per Pound
        You're about to get on a long flight, but you accidentally left your
        coat, iPad, Kindle, and your collection of cereal-box backs at the hotel.
        You have Â£20, room for six magazines, and a list of magazines. Pick the
        six magazines with the most pages while staying under budget so you
        don't die of boredom.
